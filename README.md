# my-IaC

This repository is intended to specify my frequently used server instances following the "Infrastrucure as a code" approach.

All server instances will be specified below the servers folder, which contain sub folders for different classes of servers.

Below the server class (e.g. docker-engine), the IaC files can be found below different kinds of technologies (e.g. vagrant)
